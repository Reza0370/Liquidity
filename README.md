# Liquidity

An important metric for marketplaces in general is called liquidity. It is a measure for the health of a marketplace and tells us something about how quickly listings are being sold. Before we can investigate opportunities to improve the liquidity, we first need to come up with a concrete measure for liquidity. Because we aim to base decisions on this metric, we should be able to monitor this measure continuously. A good measure for liquidity is the sell-through rate (STR). This represents the share of sold listings.
